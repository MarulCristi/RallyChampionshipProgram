This program makes use of the SOLID principles, like Open/Close Principle (RallyCar and its subclasses handle car  functionality), Liskov Substitution Principle (AsphaltCar & GravelCar can be used wherever RallyCar is required), Interface Segregation (RaceResult defines only methods) and Dependency Inversion. It also uses Singleton (ChampionshipManager), to ensure a single championship instance.
